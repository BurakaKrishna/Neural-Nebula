# Neural-Nebula
A deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is trained on pictures of space. Images can be procedurally generated from interpolating over the latent space. Information on the neural network can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434

## Dependencies
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- Keras, Tensorflow==1.4, Matplotlib, Numpy, PIL, Scikit-learn

# Downloading a new data set

# Training a new model

# Customizing the network
Edit these lines in the code: 

# Exporting a model to Unity
The reason I quoted tensorflow v1.4 in the dependencies is to match the version of tensorflow in UnityML just incase you want to upload these models into Unity

- export_model
- load into unity
- attach mesh generator script
